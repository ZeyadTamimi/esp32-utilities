# ESP32 / FreeRTOS C++ Utilities Library

This library offers some basic utilities used by the rest of my projects for either the ESP32 or
FreeRTOS.

## Setup
Simply add the repository to your ESP IDF Project's component directory:
```bash
    mkdir -p components && git submodule add <url> components/utilities
```

## Usage
Simply include the ```utilities.hpp```
file which will handle including the rest of the utilities.
